# ⚛️ TypeScript in React – The Complete Guide

Welcome to the **TypeScript in React** section of this repository — your go-to source for mastering **strongly typed React applications** like a senior dev.

Whether you're migrating a codebase, starting fresh with `create-react-app`, or scaling up with `Next.js`, understanding how to write *type-safe*, *robust*, and *reusable* components is key to building production-grade frontend systems.

## 🧠 Why This Section Exists

JavaScript may let you ship fast, but TypeScript helps you ship right.  
React + TypeScript is the future-proof stack used by companies like Meta, Shopify, Stripe, and more.

This guide aims to eliminate the confusion and friction around typing React code by giving you practical examples, reusable patterns, and real-world logic — not just academic syntax dumps.

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn

By the end of this section, you’ll be able to:

- Confidently type components, props, refs, and state
- Handle forms and DOM events without losing your sanity
- Share logic across components with typed context and custom hooks
- Safely work with external APIs and data schemas
- Build flexible UIs using render props, generics, and discriminated unions
- Use utility types like `Partial`, `Pick`, and `Record` to model UI behavior

## Each folder under concepts includes:

- ✅ Typed examples using `tsx`

## 🔍 Explanation of key concepts
- 💡 `notes.md` with detailed explanations and tips
- 🧪 Practice-based `recap.md` with self-checks and a quiz
- 📚 `quiz-answers.md` with answers to self-check questions

## 🧰 Prerequisites

To follow along, make sure you’re comfortable with:

- Basic React (JSX, state, props, hooks)
- TypeScript fundamentals (interfaces, types, unions)
- Familiarity with VS Code, Tailwind, and React DevTools

## 🧾 Using the Code

```bash
# First, go to the react-playground directory
cd src/4-typescript-in-react/react-playground

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

## 🧠 Ready for Recap?
Once you’ve finished all sections, head over to [`recap.md`](./recap.md) for a quick summary of key concepts and patterns. It’s designed to reinforce what you’ve learned and help you apply it in real projects.

You can also find a self-check quiz to test your understanding. If you get stuck, refer to the [`notes.md`](./notes.md) for detailed explanations and tips.

You’ll find a self-check quiz and key takeaways for revision for answers, refers to the [`quiz-answers.md`](./quiz-answers.md) but only if you are really strucked.
