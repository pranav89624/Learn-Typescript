# 🚀 Advanced Types in TypeScript

Welcome to the **Advanced Types** section, where TypeScript gets seriously powerful.

This section is designed to level you up with concepts 
used in **robust, large scale, and type-safe applications**, including type-level programming, complex 
transforms, and type manipulation patterns.

---

## 📦 What You'll Learn

This section dives deep into:

- ✅ Type Narrowing
- ✅ Generics
- ✅ Conditional Types
- ✅ The `infer` Keyword
- ✅ Discriminated Unions
- ✅ Mapped Types
- ✅ Key Remapping
- ✅ Template Literal Types
- ✅ Utility Types
- ✅ Type-Level Functions
- ✅ Branded Types
- ✅ Recursive Types

---

## ⚠️ Heads-Up: What You *May* Skip

Some concepts here are **not used in daily development**, especially in small to mid-scale apps.  
If you're short on time or just want practical knowledge, feel free to **skip** these:

- `infer` keyword  
- Key Remapping  
- Type-Level Functions  
- Branded Types  
- Recursive Types  

These are **more useful in libraries**, complex types, or advanced tooling, not typical CRUD apps.

You won’t lose dev credibility by skipping them. But knowing they *exist* can help when you encounter them in open-source projects or job interviews.

## 🧠 How to Use This Section

1. **Start with [`notes.md`](./notes.md)**  
   Read each topic one by one with live code references in `.ts` files.

2. **Run code files**  
   All code examples can be executed directly if your TypeScript environment is set up.  
   Each `.ts` file corresponds to a section in `notes.md`.

3. **Use [`recap.md`](./recap.md) to revise**  
   Revisit all key ideas and try self-checks.

4. **Validate with [`quiz-answer.md`](./quiz-answer.md)**  
   Compare your answers and patch your understanding.

That’s where we **apply all of this** in real world frontend development.
