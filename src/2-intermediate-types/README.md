# 🎯 Intermediate TypeScript – Level Up Your TS Skills

Welcome to the **Intermediate Types** section of this TypeScript learning repo.  
This part of the journey is where you'll start writing **developer-grade TypeScript**, structured, safe, and scalable.

---

## 🧩 What This Section Covers

This section builds upon your core TS knowledge and dives deep into:

- ✅ Type Aliases vs Interfaces
- 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- 🔁 Method & Function Overloading
- 📦 Namespaces & Modules
- 📄 Index Signatures
- ⚔️ `unknown` vs `any`
- 🧠 `satisfies` operator
- 🌀 Declaration Merging
- 🛡 Optional & Readonly Modifiers

---

## 🧠 Prerequisites

To get the most out of this section, you should already be comfortable with:

- Basic JavaScript (ES6+)
- TypeScript fundamentals (covered in `1-core-types`)
- Working with Node.js, `tsc`, and your terminal

If you're still shaky on the basics, complete `1-core-types/` first, this section **assumes you're ready to go deeper**.

---

## 🗂️ How This Section Is Structured

Each sub-topic includes:

1. `notes.md` – A focused explanation with real-world dev mindset  
2. `.ts` file(s) – Hands-on code examples and challenge solutions  
3. Optional `recap.md` and `quiz-answer.md`, for active recall and revision

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

Make sure you've compiled your TypeScript with the right config.  
To run any file from this section:

```bash
tsc

node dist/2-intermediate-types/path-to-your-file.js
```
- ✅ All TS files live inside /src
- 📁 Output JS files land in /dist (configured via tsconfig.json)

## 📘 Tips for Getting the Most Value
- ✅ Read the notes.md before touching the code
- ⌨️ Try solving challenges before looking at solutions
- 🧠 Revisit the recap.md at the end
- ⚡ Don’t blindly memorize, understand why the type system exists

## 🧭 Ready to Begin?
Start from the top with [`type-aliases`](./01-type-aliases.ts) <br>
and work your way down the list, or jump to a section you’re struggling with.

## 🏁 Completed This Section?
Check out the [`recap.md`](./recap.md) for a full summary and quiz. <br>
You can verify your answers in [`quiz-answers.md`](./quiz-answers.md).

## 🏆 Keep Your Momentum Going!
Once you finish this section, you’ll be ready to tackle the [**`Advanced Types`**](../3-advanced-types/) section, where you’ll learn about mapped types, conditional types, utility types, template literal types, and more. These tools will let you write ultra flexible, expressive, and DRY TypeScript code that scales effortlessly.
