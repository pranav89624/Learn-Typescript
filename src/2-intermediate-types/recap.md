# üß† Intermediate Types Recap

## What You‚Äôve Mastered So Far

- **Type Aliases & Interfaces**  
  Learned how to define reusable types and the subtle differences between aliases and interfaces.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  Covered classes, constructors, `this` keyword, access modifiers, inheritance, getters/setters, static members, abstract classes, and design patterns crucial for scalable, maintainable code.

- **Method & Function Overloading**  
  Mastered how to declare multiple function signatures and implement flexible APIs.

- **Namespaces & Modules**  
  Explored ways to organize code and avoid name collisions in large codebases.

- **Index Signatures**  
  Allowed objects with dynamic keys while maintaining type safety.

- **Unknown vs Any**  
  Understood the risks of `any` and the safer alternative `unknown`, with practical narrowing techniques.

- **Satisfies Operator**  
  Leveraged TypeScript 4.9+‚Äôs new operator to validate types while preserving exact inference.

- **Declaration Merging**  
  Discovered how TypeScript combines multiple declarations with the same name and use cases for interfaces, namespaces, and function merging.

- **Optional & Readonly Properties**  
  Learned to make properties optional or immutable, improving API flexibility and safety.

## Self Check Questions

1. When should you use an interface vs a type alias?  
2. How does TypeScript enforce type safety with `unknown`?  
3. What‚Äôs the advantage of `satisfies` over simple type annotations?  
4. How does declaration merging help extend third-party types?  
5. Why is method overloading useful in API design?  
6. How do `optional` and `readonly` modifiers affect object properties?  
7. What is the difference between namespaces and modules in organizing code?  
8. Explain how getters and setters control property access in classes.

## What‚Äôs Next?

Prepare for the [**`Advanced Types`**](../3-advanced-types/) section, where you‚Äôll dive deep into mapped types, conditional types, utility types, template literal types, and more. These tools will let you write ultra flexible, expressive, and DRY TypeScript code that scales effortlessly.
