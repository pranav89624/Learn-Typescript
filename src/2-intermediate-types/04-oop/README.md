# 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript

Welcome to the **OOP Subsection** of the Intermediate TypeScript learning path.

This section is designed to make you **production-ready** with object-oriented concepts in TypeScript, often used in real-world apps, large-scale systems, and backend architecture.

> 📌 You must have completed [Core Types](../../1-core-types/README.md) and previous sections of the Intermediate TypeScript path before coming here.

## 📚 What You’ll Learn

| Concept                  | Description                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Classes & Objects      | Learn to define and create blueprint-based objects          |
| ✅ Constructors           | Understand object instantiation and initialization          |
| ✅ `this` Keyword         | Understand execution context within classes                 |
| ✅ Access Modifiers       | Learn `public`, `private`, and `protected` in real usage    |
| ✅ Inheritance            | Implement code reuse using `extends` and `super()`          |
| ✅ Getters & Setters      | Encapsulate property access and validation cleanly          |
| ✅ Static Members         | Use class-level properties and methods                      |
| ✅ Abstract Classes       | Create forced contracts and reusable blueprints             |
| ✅ OOP Design Patterns    | Implement `Singleton`, `Factory`, `Observer` patterns       |

## ⚙️ How to Run a File

```bash
# Compile:
tsc

# Then run:
node dist/2-intermediate-types/04-oop/01-classes-objects.js
```
Your TypeScript is configured to output `.js` files in a mirrored `dist/` folder. This keeps the project clean.

## 📝 Notes & Learning Content
Each `.ts` file is backed by rich, developer-focused notes in [`oop-notes.md`](./oop-notes.md).

You’ll also find:
- **Code challenges** to test your understanding
- **Mini examples** to illustrate concepts
- **Key takeaways** summarizing each topic

📌 At the end of the section, review [`recap.md`](./recap.md) for a self-test and summary.

## 🧪 Challenge Yourself
Most topics come with practical mini-challenges so you don’t just read, you `build`.

Feel free to fork, tweak, and even break things!

## ✅ Finished?
Awesome! Head over to the next intermediate section:

[`Method Overloading`](../05-method-overloading.ts) to continue your TypeScript journey.
