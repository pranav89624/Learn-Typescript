## üéì Special Guidelines for Educational Repositories

### For Learners
- **No question is too basic** - everyone starts somewhere
- **Mistakes are part of learning** - don't be afraid to share code that doesn't work

- **Be specific** when asking for help - include code, error messages, and what you've tried
- **Thank those who help you** and consider helping others when you can

### For Experienced Contributors
- **Remember your first days learning** - be the mentor you wish you had
- **Explain the "why"** not just the "how" when helping others
- **Provide context** and learning resources, not just quick fixes
