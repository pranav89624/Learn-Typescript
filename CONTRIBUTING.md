## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

#### TypeScript Code
- **Use strict mode** - All TypeScript should compile with `strict: true`
- **Add type annotations** - Be explicit with types for educational clarity
- **Include comments** - Explain complex concepts and edge cases
- **Follow naming conventions** - Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Test your code** - Ensure all examples compile and run correctly

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good example
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}

// Clear function with explicit types and documentation
function createUser(userData: Omit<User, 'id'>): User {
  // Generate a unique ID (simplified for demo)
  const id = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
  
  return {
    id,
    ...userData
  };
}
```

#### Documentation
- **Write clear explanations** - Assume readers are learning
- **Use proper Markdown formatting** - Headers, code blocks, lists
- **Add examples** - Show both correct and incorrect usage when helpful
- **Be concise but complete** - Balance detail with readability

### File Organization

#### New Code Examples
- Place files in the appropriate section (`1-core-types`, `2-intermediate-types`, etc.)
- Use descriptive filenames following the existing pattern
- Include a comment block at the top explaining the concept

#### Documentation Updates
- Update relevant `README.md` files in section folders
- Add entries to `notes.md` files for detailed explanations
- Update the main README.md if adding new sections

### Commit Standards

Use clear, descriptive commit messages following this format:

```bash
# Format: <type>: <description>
# Examples:
git commit -m "feat: add advanced generics examples"
git commit -m "fix: correct type annotation in union types"
git commit -m "docs: improve explanation of type guards"
git commit -m "style: fix formatting in functions section"
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New feature or example
- `fix`: Bug fix or correction
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, no code change
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
